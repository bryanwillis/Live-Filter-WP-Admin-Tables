A WordPress plugin that alters the admin tables to so quick filtering can be done from the search bar. This is generally for people who have long tables and don't use the paging functionality.

== Description ==


Powered by the awesome Jquery.FilterTable created by SunnyWalker
http://sunnywalker.github.io/jQuery.FilterTable/


See the site for a full list of paramaters. The plugin has many more options than I've used. 

Future releases will include ajax-paging/autoscroll, sticky table headers, and an options page to enable/disable paramaters.
Use this with codepress-admin-columns to really unleash it's potential.



== Installation ==

1. Upload folder `floating-publish-button` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
